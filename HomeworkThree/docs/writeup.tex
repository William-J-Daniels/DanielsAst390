\section{Euler and Euler-Cromer methods on a simple pendulum}

\begin{figure}[!b]

  \caption{Comparison of Euler and Euler-Cromer methods for a pendulum starting
    from rest at 10 and 100 degrees using a time step of 0.1 seconds}
  \label{fig:pend}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pend} displays the behavior of two methods for the specified
pendulum. We expect the Euler method to cause the amplitude  to tend towards
infinity but that is not what we observe. I was unable to produce this behavior
for any combination of time step or run time that did not also cause the same to
occur with the Euler-Cromer. It is unclear to me if that is because my
implementation has a mistake or because I was unable to find a good set of
parameters.

The period of the Euler and Euler-Cromer methods seem to agree for the same
initial conditions; for 10 degrees, we observe a period of about 6 seconds and
for 100 degrees we observe a period of about 8 seconds.

\section{Velocity-verlet method on a simple pendulum}

Table \ref{tab:pend} shows the ratio of the initial energy to the energy after a
number of periods for the velocity-verlet pendulum. Since the velocity-verlet
method is symplectic, the result that the energy is the same when varying the
time step is expected.
