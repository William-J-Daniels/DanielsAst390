Build instructions:

Create a new build directory and change into it. Run cmake a directory up then
run make.

mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

Run instructions:

Executables are placed in subdirectories of the build directory corresponding
to the source directory. For example, to run HomeworkOne executables, change to
build/HomeworkOne/ and run those executables.
